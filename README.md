# Ze

### Purpose
Project Ze is a text-analysis app designed for our 8-day capstone project at [Dev Bootcamp](http://devbootcamp.com/locations/chicago). The app analyzes text for sentiment and bias towards a particular gender, utilizing IBM Bluemix's Alchemy API and a customized gender detection algorithm. Technologies used include JavaScript front-end built over Rails back-end, D3.js visualizations, Twitter API, and Dropzone.js.
